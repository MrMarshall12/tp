# ServeMate User Guide

## Introduction
Managing customer records and delivery schedules for a Tingkat catering business can quickly become overwhelming when information is scattered across spreadsheets, notebooks and chat messages.
This is where **ServeMate** comes in.

**ServeMate** is a desktop application designed to help administrative staff organize customer contacts and delivery details. Optimized for fast typing through a Command Line Interface (CLI), **ServeMate** allows you to quickly add, update, and retrieve customer records without navigating through complicated menus.

## Features

<box type="info" light>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Halal` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Vegetarian`, `t/Vegetarian t/East` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Dates are in `yyyy-MM-dd` format, where `yyyy` is the 4-digit year, `MM` is the 2-digit month, and `dd` is the 2-digit day.<br>
  e.g. 9th March 2026 can be written has `2026-03-09`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ServeMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
