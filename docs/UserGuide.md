# ServeMate User Guide

## Introduction
Managing customer records and delivery schedules for a Tingkat catering business can quickly become overwhelming when information is scattered across spreadsheets, notebooks and chat messages.
This is where **ServeMate** comes in.

**ServeMate** is a desktop application designed to help administrative staff of a single plan Tingkat caterer organize customer contacts and delivery details. Optimized for fast typing through a Command Line Interface (CLI), **ServeMate** allows you to quickly add, update, and retrieve customer records without navigating through complicated menus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that Java `17` or later installed on your computer. <br>
If Java is not installed, follow the installation guide for your operating system:
   * **Windows:** [Java installation guide for Windows](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html).
   * **Mac:** [Java installation guide for Mac](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
   * **Linux:** [Java installation guide for Linux](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ServeMate.

1. Open a command terminal and run the application using:
   ```shell
   cd [home-folder]
   java -jar ServeMate.jar
   ```
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="UI" width="500"/>
* The customer panel on the left allows you to view customer information, including their full delivery details.
* The delivery panel on the right allows you to view today's deliveries. It provides a quick reference to view deliveries scheduled for the current day, from earliest to latest delivery time.
* You can adjust the width of the panels by left-clicking and dragging the divider between them.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The date shown on the delivery panel is based on your computer's date setting. If you find today's date is incorrectly reflected, check that your computer's date is correct, then close and relaunch ServeMate.
</box>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ServeMate.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" light>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Halal` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Vegetarian`, `t/Vegetarian t/NoSeafood` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Dates are in `yyyy-MM-dd` format, where `yyyy` is the 4-digit year, `MM` is the 2-digit month, and `dd` is the 2-digit day.<br>
  e.g. 9th March 2026 can be written has `2026-03-09`.

* Tags (`t/[TAG]`) are intended for use in placing delivery notes for a particular customer.
  * Tags should only consist of alphanumerical values without whitespaces.
  * Suggested usages:
    * Dietary restrictions of the customer (i.e. `t/Vegetarian`).
    * The region where the customer lives (i.e. `t/West`).

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing the data file

ServeMate data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" light>

**Warning:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ServeMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ServeMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Question**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**Answer**: Install the ServeMate application on your second computer by following the instructions in the "Quick Start" section. On your original computer, locate the `[JAR file location]/data` folder which should contain the `addressbook.json` data file. Copy the `data` folder to your second computer, and place it in the ServeMate application folder located at `[JAR file location]` (if the `data` folder already exists, replace it). Run the ServeMate application on your second computer. You should be able to see the data you have transferred.
<br>

**Question**: Why does the delivery panel not automatically update today's date and deliveries when the time passes 12 midnight?<br>
**Answer**: ServeMate currently does not support automatically refreshing the date on the delivery panel if the time passes 12 midnight, in case you are still referring to the previous day's deliveries. To refresh the date on the panel, simply close and relaunch ServeMate.
<br>

**Question**: Why can't I use the delivery panel to view deliveries on other dates?<br>
**Answer**: ServeMate currently does not support viewing deliveries on other dates in the delivery panel. The delivery panel is intended as a quick reference to view deliveries scheduled on the current day for your operations. If you need to view deliveries on other dates, you can use the `find-delivery` command.
<br>

**Question**: Why is the delivery panel wider than the customer panel when I make the ServeMate application window narrower?<br>
**Answer**: When the ServeMate application window is narrow, the delivery panel is given a larger width to provide a quick reference to deliveries scheduled on the current day. If you need to view more information in the customer panel, you can resize the application window and expand the customer panel for a better viewing experience.
<br>

**Question**: Why does the `find` command only return customers that matches all filters?<br>
**Answer**: ServeMate's `find` command is designed to match all filters so you can easily narrow down to the most relevant results to find the customer that you are looking for (e.g. `find n/John a/Clementi` finds all customers named `John` with an address containing `Clementi`). <br>
If you like to find customers matching any of the filters (e.g. find all customers with name `Richard` or address `Jurong`), you may issue separate commands (e.g. `find n/Richard` and `find a/Jurong`).
<br>

**Question**: Why does the `find` command use full word matching for keywords?<br>
**Answer**: ServeMate's `find` command does not support partial word matching, to reduce the number of irrelevant results returned so that you can find customers quickly. In the event that you might not remember exactly the full word to search for (e.g. `Richard` or `Richards`), you may specify multiple keywords within a filter (e.g. `find n/Richard Richards`) to find customers matching any 1 keyword.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
<box type="warning" light>

**Warning:**
The `preferences.json` file saves configuration settings used by ServeMate. We recommend that you do not edit the file directly as certain edits can cause ServeMate to behave in unexpected ways. Therefore, edit the file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Coming soon
1. **Integrated `find` command:** Finding specific deliveries will be easier and more convenient! We plan to combine the `find-delivery` and `find` commands, so that you can search for both delivery details (e.g. dates) and customer details (e.g. address) all at once.
2. **Refresh delivery panel:** Currently, you need to relaunch ServeMate to view deliveries scheduled for the new day. Soon, you will be able to refresh the delivery panel whenever needed to view deliveries scheduled on the current day without relaunching ServeMate.
