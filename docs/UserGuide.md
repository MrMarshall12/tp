# ServeMate User Guide

## Introduction
Managing customer records and delivery schedules for a Tingkat catering business can quickly become overwhelming when information is scattered across spreadsheets, notebooks and chat messages.
This is where **ServeMate** comes in.

**ServeMate** is a desktop application designed to help administrative staff organize customer contacts and delivery details. Optimized for fast typing through a Command Line Interface (CLI), **ServeMate** allows you to quickly add, update, and retrieve customer records without navigating through complicated menus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that Java `17` or later installed on your computer. <br>
If Java is not installed, follow the installation guide for your operating system:
   * **Windows:** [Java installation guide for Windows](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html).
   * **Mac:** [Java installation guide for Mac](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
   * **Linux:** [Java installation guide for Linux](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ServeMate.

1. Open a command terminal and run the application using:
   ```shell
   cd [home-folder]
   java -jar ServeMate.jar
   ```
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ServeMate.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ServeMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ServeMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ServeMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
